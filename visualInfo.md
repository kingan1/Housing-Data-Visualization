# [What does each visual represent](#home)

When creating visuals for our data, it is important to know where the data came from, how it is important, and why we used a specific visual. 

On this page, I go into what each visual means, and how it contributes to our dataset as a whole.


# [Figure 0 - Price vs Year Built](#price-vs-year)

# [Ratio of beds and baths vs price](#bed-baths-vs-price)

# [Average price based on number of beds](#beds-vs-price)
